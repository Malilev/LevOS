# LevOS 2.0 - Claude Code Instructions

## Git Rules

**NEVER push or commit files from the `do not push/` folder.**

This folder contains private/draft materials that should not be in the repository.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main application file (React + Tailwind)
- `do not push/` - Private files, DO NOT COMMIT

## Scenario Timing

- 1st in queue: arrive by 8:30-8:40
- 2nd in queue: arrive by 10:00
- 3rd in queue: arrive by 12:00 (call to confirm! might be 15:00)
- 4th+ in queue: arrive by 15:00
